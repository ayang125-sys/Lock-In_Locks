    "Initial load: Goal setup screen displays correctly when no localStorage data exists",
    "Form fields: All three required fields (distraction, goal, deadline) present and empty initially", 
    "Submit button state: Disabled (grey) when fields empty, active (green) when all filled",
    "Distraction field: Text input accepts user input correctly",
    "Category dropdown: All 6 categories (📱 Phone, 🎮 Gaming, 📺 TV, 🍕 Snacks, 🎵 Music, 🔒 Other) display and selectable",
    "Goal field: Textarea accepts multi-line input correctly",
    "Deadline field: Date/time picker accepts future dates and displays correctly",
    "Human-readable deadline: Formatted deadline displays below picker (e.g., 'Locked until Saturday, December 20, 2025 at 5:30 PM')",
    "Form validation: Button transitions from disabled to active when all fields filled",
    "Whitespace validation: Empty fields with only whitespace properly rejected",
    "Submit functionality: Clicking active button triggers submission successfully",
    "localStorage persistence: All 4 values saved correctly (distraction_name, distraction_category, goal_description, goal_deadline)",
    "Confirmation overlay: Appears immediately after submit with correct data display",
    "Confirmation content: Category emoji, distraction name, goal description, and formatted deadline display correctly",
    "Confirmation message: 'Your lock is now active.' displays in green as expected",
    "Auto-routing: Confirmation shows for 2 seconds then routes to dashboard automatically",
    "Dashboard integration: Successfully navigates to existing dashboard component",
    "Persistent data flow: After reload with localStorage data, skips goal setup and goes directly to dashboard",
    "All categories functional: Phone, Gaming, TV, Snacks, Music, and Other categories all work correctly",
    "localStorage cleanup: Clearing localStorage returns user to goal setup screen",
    "Mobile responsive: 390px mobile viewport renders and functions perfectly"
